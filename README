After looking for a jQuery plugin for handling a 'tag suggestion' form field, in much the same way ZenDesk.com does, I ended up developing a customization of jQuery UI that does the same interaction.

Check the example.html for a demo.

Notice, to make it work under IE you have to add 'js/ie-compat.js' into your pages.
